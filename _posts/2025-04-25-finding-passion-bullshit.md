# Finding Your Passion Is Bullsh*t – Here’s What Works Instead

If you’ve ever been told to “just follow your passion,”  
first of all, I’m sorry.  
Second, that’s **terrible advice**.

Because here’s the raw, unfiltered truth:  
Most people don’t wake up one day, have an epiphany under a waterfall, and suddenly know they’re destined to be artisanal soap makers or blockchain developers or full-time TikTok philosophers.

Life doesn’t work like a Disney movie.  
It’s more like a confusing Netflix series that got canceled mid-season.

## 💥 The Passion Myth They Sold You

The myth goes something like this:  
If you just sit quietly and *believe hard enough*, your “true passion” will magically reveal itself like a Hogwarts letter.

Nope.

In reality?

- Your passions are **built**, not discovered.
- They evolve as you grow.
- They are messy, unpredictable, and often start out boring AF.

## 🛠️ What Actually Works (and It’s Not Sitting Around)

Wanna know how people actually find meaningful work or hobbies they love?  
They **try a bunch of stuff**, **suck at it for a while**, and **then get slightly less bad over time**.

Here’s the boring but brutally honest 3-step formula:

1. **Explore Widely:**  
   Take messy action. Try photography. Build a dumb app. Write a blog no one reads (hi 👋). Flip stuff on eBay. Paint terrible art. Doesn’t matter. Just start.
   
2. **Stick Around Long Enough to Suck Less:**  
   Passion usually blooms after skill grows. You don’t love guitar when you’re strumming wrong chords—you love it when you finally nail "Wonderwall" and someone claps.
   
3. **Listen to Curiosity, Not Destiny:**  
   Follow what *interests* you, even if it’s weird, random, or uncool. Curiosity is low-key your life's GPS.

## 🔥 But What If I Pick the "Wrong" Thing?

Bro. Sis. Gengs.  
Everything you pick will feel wrong at first.

That’s how learning curves work.  
That’s how growth happens.  
That’s what makes *anything* worth doing feel valuable later.

Choosing *something*—even if it’s messy—is better than sitting in existential paralysis for five years waiting for “the right moment.”

Momentum > Perfection.

## 🎯 TL;DR (Because You’re Probably Multitasking)

- Passion is overrated. Action is underrated.
- You don’t “find” your passion. You **build** it like IKEA furniture—with confusion, frustration, and weird leftover screws.
- Start small. Start badly. Start anyway.

*Author’s Note:*  
This isn’t about giving up on dreams.  
It’s about building dreams like adults—one frustrating, sweaty brick at a time. Welcome to real life.
